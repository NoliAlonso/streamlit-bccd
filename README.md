# Streamlit App for Blood Cell Count Dataset

This app allows you to upload an image of blood cells and use an [object detection model](https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection) to detect the white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

The app is [hosted here](https://share.streamlit.io/matthewbrems/streamlit-bccd):

```

The app will work as is. The code made available here will work _except you will need your own API key_. [Create a Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com) to get your own API key.

Want to [build and deploy your own object detection model and app](https://blog.streamlit.io/p/2289e8b8-8acf-499c-ba40-a7387f298a9d/)? Follow the steps in our "How To" blog!

This app was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
